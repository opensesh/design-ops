# /design-ops:setup

Main onboarding wizard for DESIGN-OPS. Guides users through connecting data sources across three business pillars: Operations, Design, and Analytics.

## Trigger

User runs `/design-ops:setup` to configure the plugin. Works in:
- Claude Code CLI (terminal) — full interactive setup
- Claude Desktop (Code tab) — full interactive setup
- Claude Co-work (web) — read-only mode, directs to terminal

---

## Design Philosophy

This setup flow is **tool-agnostic** and **outcome-driven**:
- Ask what tools they use, discover how to connect
- Evaluate each tool for MCP or API capabilities
- Let users select what data they want in their briefs
- Adapt to whatever combination of tools the user has

---

## Pre-Flight Check

Before starting, detect the environment and existing setup:

### 1. Environment Detection

```
if (web/co-work environment detected):
  Show current config status
  Display: "For full setup, run /design-ops:setup in Claude Code CLI"
  Exit early
```

### 1.5 Secrets Manager Detection

Check for available secrets managers before proceeding with tool setup:

```bash
# Detection order (check for CLI availability)
1. 1Password CLI: `which op` or `op --version`
2. Bitwarden CLI: `which bw`
3. macOS Keychain: `which security` (fallback)
4. None detected
```

**If 1Password detected:**

```markdown
## Secure Secrets Management

Found: **1Password CLI** (`op` command available)

DESIGN-OPS can help you store API keys securely in 1Password.
This keeps your credentials safe and shareable with your team.

**Benefits:**
- No plain-text secrets in config files
- Easy rotation when keys expire
- Team sharing without copying keys
- Audit trail of access

**What would you like to do?**
- [Set up 1Password integration (recommended)] — I'll guide you through it
- [I'll manage secrets myself] — Skip this step
- [Tell me more] — Learn about secrets management
```

**[Set up 1Password integration]:**

```markdown
### 1Password Setup

**Step 1: Create a vault (optional)**
You can use your Personal vault or create a dedicated one:
```bash
op vault create "DESIGN-OPS" --description "API keys for DESIGN-OPS"
```

**Step 2: Add this to your shell profile (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc):**

```bash
# DESIGN-OPS Secrets via 1Password
load_design_ops_secrets() {
  if ! op account get &>/dev/null; then
    eval $(op signin)
  fi
  export NOTION_API_KEY="$(op read 'op://DESIGN-OPS/Notion API/credential' 2>/dev/null)"
  export GA4_PROPERTY_ID="$(op read 'op://DESIGN-OPS/Google Analytics/property_id' 2>/dev/null)"
  echo "DESIGN-OPS secrets loaded"
}
```

**Step 3: Run `source ~/.zshrc` to reload**

As we set up each tool, I'll help you store its credentials in 1Password.

[Continue to tool setup →]
```

**[Tell me more]:**

Show summary from `references/security.md`, then return to options.

**If no secrets manager detected:**

```markdown
## Secrets Management Notice

No secrets manager CLI detected (1Password, Bitwarden).

**Security recommendation:** Store API keys in a secrets manager instead of plain text.

**Quick options:**
- Install 1Password CLI: `brew install --cask 1password-cli`
- Install Bitwarden CLI: `brew install bitwarden-cli`

For now, you can continue — just be careful not to commit keys to git.

📖 See: references/security.md for detailed setup

[Continue anyway] | [I'll install 1Password first]
```

Store detection result in memory for use during tool setup:

```yaml
_session:
  secrets_manager: "1password" | "bitwarden" | "none"
  secrets_vault: "DESIGN-OPS"  # If using 1Password
```

### 2. Check Existing Configuration

1. **Check for existing config** at `~/.claude/design-ops-config.yaml`
   - If exists, check version field
   - If v1.x: "Found v1 config. Want to migrate to the new pillar-based format?"
   - If v2.x: "You have an existing config. What would you like to do?"
   - Options: `Update existing` | `Start fresh` | `Just show status`

2. **Check for legacy config** at `~/.claude/team-pulse-config.yaml`
   - If exists without design-ops-config: "Found legacy team-pulse config. Want to migrate it?"
   - Options: `Migrate to new format` | `Start fresh`

3. **Check existing skills** at `~/.claude/skills/`
   - Note any conflicting skill names
   - Plan to offer merge options if conflicts found

A Claude Code plugin for design companies and entrepreneurs.

Works in:
• Claude Code (terminal)
• Claude Desktop (Code tab)
• VS Code Extension

We'll set up your data sources across three pillars:

1. Operations — Calendar, tasks, communication
2. Design — Code repos, design files
3. Analytics — Web, links, social

Let's get started.
```

---

## Chapter 1: Operations

**Goal**: Connect tools for coordination, scheduling, task management

### Step 1.1: Tool Selection

Use AskUserQuestion with checkboxes:

```markdown
## Operations — What tools do you use for coordination?

Select all that apply:
```

Options:
- `Notion` — Tasks, docs, wikis
- `Google Workspace` — Calendar, email, docs
- `Linear` — Issue tracking
- `Asana` — Project management
- `Slack` — Communication
- `Other` — Free text input
- `None / Skip this section`

### Step 1.2: Tool Evaluation (Async)

**For each selected tool, spawn a background sub-agent to evaluate:**

```markdown
[Checking your tools... ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 2/3]
```

Use the Task tool with `subagent_type: Explore` and `run_in_background: true`:

```yaml
task: tool_evaluation
input:
  tools: [notion, google_workspace]
  pillar: operations
```

The sub-agent for each tool:
1. Check if MCP exists and is connected (read `~/.claude/settings.json`)
2. If MCP connected, catalog its reporting capabilities
3. If MCP not connected but available, note it needs setup
4. If no MCP, evaluate if API exists for reporting
5. If no API suitable, mark as unavailable
6. Return capability matrix

### Step 1.3: Present Findings

Once evaluation completes, show what's actually available.

**Connection Status Legend** (show at top of each pillar's findings):

```markdown
**Connection Status:**
• ✓ **Connected** — MCP working and ready
• ✓+ **Connected (API enhances)** — MCP works; optional API adds reporting depth
• ○ **Available** — Official MCP exists, ready to install
• ⚡ **API Only** — No official MCP; direct API integration
• ✗ **Unavailable** — No viable connection method
```

Show findings with clear status and source:

```markdown
## Here's what we found for your Operations tools:

┌──────────────────┬────────────┬──────────┬────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tool             │ Connection │ Source   │ Available Data                 │
├──────────────────┼────────────┼──────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
│ Notion           │ MCP ✓      │ Official │ Pages, databases, tasks        │
│                  │            │          │ ↳ Daily: recent pages, tasks   │
│                  │            │          │ ↳ Weekly: page activity        │
├──────────────────┼────────────┼──────────┼────────────────────────────────┤

├──────────────────┼────────────┼──────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
│ Slack            │ MCP ○      │ Community│ Messages, channels             │
│                  │ (install)  │          │ ↳ Unread counts, messages      │
└──────────────────┴────────────┴──────────┴────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Source indicators:**
- **Official** — Published by Anthropic or tool vendor
- **Vendor** — Published by the tool's company
- **Community** — Community-maintained package
- **—** — Direct API (no MCP)

### Step 1.4: Handle Available Tools

For tools with ○ Available status (MCP exists but not installed):

#### stdio MCPs (npm packages)

```markdown
### {Tool} — Available

An official MCP exists for {Tool}. Install it to enable automatic data access.

**Install command:**
```bash
claude mcp add {tool} -- npx -y {package}
```

What would you like to do?
- [Install now] — Run the install command
- [Skip for now] — Continue setup, add later
- [Tell me more] — What is an MCP?
```

#### HTTP MCPs (hosted services)

For tools like Figma, Supabase, and Vercel that use HTTP-based MCPs:

```markdown
### {Tool} — Available (HTTP MCP)

{Tool} provides an official HTTP MCP. Install it to enable automatic data access.

**Install command:**
```bash
{install_cmd}
```

Note: This will open a browser for authentication.

What would you like to do?
- [Install now] — Run the install command
- [Skip for now] — Continue setup, add later
- [Tell me more] — What is an HTTP MCP?
```

**HTTP MCP Install Commands:**
- Figma: `claude mcp add --transport http figma https://mcp.figma.com/mcp`
- Supabase: `claude mcp add supabase https://api.supabase.com/mcp`
- Vercel: `claude mcp add --transport http vercel https://mcp.vercel.com`

#### Detection Logic

```yaml
# Check mcp_type from known-tools.yaml
if tool.mcp_type == "http":
  # Use HTTP install pattern
  if tool.install_cmd:
    use tool.install_cmd
  else:
    use "claude mcp add --transport http {name} {mcp_url}"

elif tool.mcp_type == "stdio":
  # Use npm package install pattern
  use "claude mcp add {name} -- npx -y {mcp_package}"
```

**Options handling:**

**[Install now]:**
Run the install command and verify:
- If successful: Update status to ✓ Connected, continue
- If auth flow triggered: Guide user through OAuth (common for HTTP MCPs)
- If fails: Show error, offer to skip or get help

**[Skip for now]:**
Mark tool as `available` in config, continue to next tool.

**[Tell me more]:**
Show the MCP education content (see section below).

### Step 1.4b: Handle Community Package Tools

For tools where only a community MCP exists, show warning:

```markdown
### Community Package Notice

{Tool} uses a community-maintained MCP package.

**Package:** `{package-name}`
**Weekly downloads:** {downloads}
**Last updated:** {date}

Community packages are not officially supported. They may:
- Stop working if not maintained
- Have security or reliability issues

**Alternatives:**
- Use direct API integration instead
- Wait for official MCP release

[Use community package] [Use direct API instead] [Skip this tool]
```

### Step 1.4c: Handle API-Only Tools

For tools with ⚡ API Only status:

```markdown
### {Tool} — API Integration

No official MCP exists for {Tool}. We'll connect via their API directly.

**To get started:**
1. Visit {api_docs_url}
2. Create an API key/token
3. Enter your credentials below

This works just as well as an MCP for reporting purposes.

Enter your API token (or press Enter to skip):
> _
```

---

### "I Need Help" — MCP vs API Education

When user selects **[I need help]**, display this content:

```markdown
### Understanding MCPs and APIs

**What's an MCP?**
An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server is a wrapper around an API that's
designed specifically for AI assistants like Claude. Think of it as a
translator that makes APIs "speak Claude's language."

**Why do both exist?**
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Your Tool (Notion, GitHub, etc.)                                   │
│       ↓                                                             │
│  Raw API — Full access to everything the tool offers                │
│       ↓                                                             │
│  MCP Server — Simplified subset optimized for AI conversations      │
│       ↓                                                             │
│  Claude — Uses MCP to access your tools                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

**The trade-off:**
• **MCPs** are easier to set up and work great for basic tasks
• **Raw APIs** often provide more data, batch operations, and advanced queries

**Example with Notion:**
| Capability              | Notion MCP | Notion API |
|-------------------------|------------|------------|
| Search pages            | ✓          | ✓          |
| Read page content       | ✓          | ✓          |
| Create/edit pages       | ✓          | ✓          |
| Query databases         | Limited    | ✓ Full     |
| Batch operations        | ✗          | ✓          |
| Activity history        | ✗          | ✓          |
| User analytics          | ✗          | ✓          |

**What DESIGN-OPS does:**
For tools where the MCP is limited, we can:
1. Help you set up direct API access for richer reporting
2. Create a custom MCP wrapper that exposes more capabilities
3. Use both together — MCP for quick tasks, API for dashboards

**Bottom line:**
Start with the MCP. If you want deeper analytics or find it limiting,
we'll help you add API access for specific features.
```

After showing education content, return to the connection options.

---

### Step 1.5: Progressive Disclosure for API Enhancements

For tools where MCP is connected but API offers richer reporting data, use progressive disclosure:

**Pattern: Soft offer after MCP connection confirmed**

```markdown
### {Tool} — Connected via MCP ✓

Your {Tool} MCP is working. Claude can:
• Search and read your pages
• Create and edit content
• Access your databases

**Optional: Enhance with API** (✓+ status)

The {Tool} API can provide additional data for richer reporting:
• Activity history — Who edited what, when
• Batch queries — Fetch data across many pages at once
• Database aggregations — Task counts, status summaries

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  You're NOT blocked — MCP-only is always valid!                     │
│                                                                     │
│  The API is an optional enhancement that unlocks richer dashboard   │
│  data. You can add it now or anytime later.                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

What would you like to do?
- [Continue with MCP only] — Works great for most use cases ← default
- [Add API for richer dashboards] — Optional enhancement
- [Tell me more] — What's the difference?
```

**Key principle:** Never block progress. MCP-only is always valid.
The API is an *optional enhancement* for users who want deeper analytics.

**Options handling:**

**[Continue with MCP only]** (default):
Mark tool as connected via MCP, proceed to next tool.

**[Tell me more]:**
Show the MCP vs API education content from "I need help" section.

**[Add API for better dashboards]:**

```markdown
### Adding {Tool} API Access

You'll keep your MCP connection AND add API access for reporting.

**To get a {Tool} API token:**
{Tool-specific instructions - example for Notion:}
1. Go to notion.so/my-integrations
2. Click "New integration"
3. Name it "DESIGN-OPS"
4. Select your workspace
5. Under "Capabilities", enable:
   - Read content ✓
   - Read user information ✓ (for activity tracking)
6. Copy the "Internal Integration Secret"

**Important:** You'll also need to share specific pages/databases
with your integration for it to access them.

Enter your token (or press Enter to skip for now):
> _
```

**Apply this pattern to tools with MCP + API options:**
- **Notion** — MCP basic, API for activity/batch queries
- **GitHub** — MCP good, API for advanced repo analytics
- **Figma** — MCP code-focused, API for team/version reporting

---

### Step 1.6: Outcome Mapping

Based on available capabilities, ask what they want in their briefs:

```markdown
## Based on your connected tools, here's what we can include:

**Daily Brief (Operations):**
☑ Today's calendar events (from Google Workspace)
☑ Tasks due today (from Notion)
☐ Unread emails (from Google Workspace)
☐ Unread Slack messages (requires Slack setup)

**Weekly Recap (Operations):**
☑ Week overview - events attended (from Google Workspace)
☑ Tasks completed this week (from Notion)
☐ Team activity summary (requires Slack)

[Confirm selections]
```

Options are pre-checked based on connected tools. Disabled options show why they're unavailable.

---

### Step 1.7: Operations Summary & Confirmation

Before moving to the next pillar, confirm completion:

```markdown
## Operations Summary

You've configured:
✓ Notion (MCP) — tasks, docs
✓ Google Workspace (MCP) — calendar, email
⚠ Slack — skipped (can add later)

**Before we move on:**
- [Add another Operations tool]
- [Continue to Design pillar →]
```

**Pattern for every tool addition within a pillar:**
```markdown
✓ {Tool} added to Operations

[Add another Operations tool] | [Continue →]
```

If user selects "Add another Operations tool", return to Step 1.1 tool selection.
If user selects "Continue", proceed to Design pillar.

---

## Chapter 2: Design

**Goal**: Connect tools for creative and development work

### Step 2.1: Tool Selection

```markdown
## Design — What tools do you use for design & code?

**Code:**
```

Options:
- `GitHub` — Repos, PRs, issues
- `GitLab`
- `Bitbucket`
- `Other` — Free text input

```markdown
**Creative:**
```

Options:
- `Figma` — Design files
- `Sketch`
- `Adobe XD`
- `Other` — Free text input
- `None / Skip this section`

### Step 2.2: Tool Evaluation

Same async evaluation pattern as Operations.

### Step 2.3: Present Findings

```markdown
## Here's what we found for your Design tools:

┌──────────────────┬────────────┬──────────┬────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tool             │ Connection │ Source   │ Available Data                 │
├──────────────────┼────────────┼──────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
│ GitHub           │ MCP ✓      │ Official │ Repos, commits, PRs, issues    │
│                  │            │          │ ↳ Daily: recent commits, PRs   │
│                  │            │          │ ↳ Weekly: team contributions   │
├──────────────────┼────────────┼──────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
│ Figma            │ API ⚡     │ —        │ Files, versions, comments      │
│                  │            │          │ ↳ Daily: files edited, users   │
│                  │            │          │ ↳ Weekly: design versions      │
├──────────────────┼────────────┼──────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
│ GitLab           │ MCP ○      │ Community│ Repos, commits, MRs            │
│                  │ (install)  │ ⚠        │ ↳ Verify package first         │
└──────────────────┴────────────┴──────────┴────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Note:** Figma's official MCP is code-focused (not for reporting). We use the API directly for team/version reporting.

### Step 2.4: Figma Handling

Figma now has an official HTTP MCP that provides comprehensive design access:

```markdown
### Figma — Available (HTTP MCP)

Figma provides an official MCP with full design access.

**Install command:**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http figma https://mcp.figma.com/mcp
```

This will:
1. Open a browser for Figma authentication
2. Request permission to access your files
3. Enable design context, screenshots, and Code Connect

What would you like to do?
- [Install now] — Run the install command
- [Skip for now] — Continue setup, add later
```

**Capabilities via Figma MCP:**
- Get design context (code, screenshots, metadata)
- Access component libraries and design systems
- Generate diagrams and capture web pages
- Search design system assets
- Code Connect mapping

**Note:** The HTTP MCP requires browser authentication. After install,
you can track specific projects in your config.

### Step 2.5: GitHub Project Selection

If GitHub MCP connected:

```markdown
### GitHub Configuration

GitHub is connected via MCP. Which repositories should I track?
```

Options:
- Show recently accessed repos if discoverable
- Allow manual entry: "Enter repo names (owner/repo format)"
- Option: "Track all repos I have access to"

### Step 2.6: Outcome Mapping

```markdown
## Based on your Design tools, here's what we can include:

**Daily (Design):**
☑ Recent commits (from GitHub) — last 24h
☑ Open PRs needing review (from GitHub)
☑ Figma files edited today (from Figma API)
☐ Who's working on what (requires team tracking setup)

**Weekly (Design):**
☑ Team contribution summary (commits by person)
☑ Design versions created (from Figma)
☑ PR/merge activity (from GitHub)

[Confirm selections]
```

---

### Step 2.7: Design Summary & Confirmation

Before moving to the next pillar, confirm completion:

```markdown
## Design Summary

You've configured:
✓ GitHub (MCP) — repos, PRs, commits
✓ Figma (API) — design files, versions
⚠ Sketch — not connected (can add later)

**Before we move on:**
- [Add another Design tool]
- [Continue to Analytics pillar →]
```

**Pattern for every tool addition within a pillar:**
```markdown
✓ {Tool} added to Design

[Add another Design tool] | [Continue →]
```

If user selects "Add another Design tool", return to Step 2.1 tool selection.
If user selects "Continue", proceed to Analytics pillar.

---

## Chapter 3: Analytics

**Goal**: Connect tools for metrics and insights

### Step 3.1: Tool Selection — Restructured by Purpose

Replace the single mixed "Which analytics tools?" with purpose-based subcategories.
Each subcategory gets its own selection and confirmation before advancing.

**Show category navigation:**

```markdown
## Analytics — Let's set up your metrics by category

We'll configure your analytics tools in 5 categories:
1. Web Analytics (visitor/session data)
2. Social Analytics (audience/engagement)
3. Content Analytics (newsletter/blog)

### Step 3.1e: Database/Product Analytics

```markdown
### Database/Product Analytics
What do you use for database or product metrics?

- [ ] Supabase — Database metrics, user counts
- [ ] Firebase — App analytics
- [ ] Amplitude — Product analytics
- [ ] Mixpanel — User analytics
- [ ] Other (specify)
- [ ] None / Skip database analytics

[Continue →]
```

**Confirmation:**
```markdown
✓ Database Analytics configured: Supabase

Want to add more database/product tools, or continue?
- [Add more database tools]
- [Continue to tool evaluation →]
```

---

### Step 3.2: Tool Evaluation

Same async pattern as Operations and Design. Analytics tools often need custom wrappers.

**For each selected tool, evaluate:**
1. Check if MCP exists and is connected
2. If MCP connected, catalog its reporting capabilities
3. If no MCP, evaluate if API exists for reporting
4. For tools with limited MCPs, note API upgrade options

### Step 3.3: Present Findings

```markdown
## Here's what we found for your Analytics tools:

┌──────────────────┬────────────┬──────────┬────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tool             │ Connection │ Source   │ Available Data                 │
├──────────────────┼────────────┼──────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
│ Google Analytics │ MCP ✓      │ Official │ Pageviews, sessions, events    │
│                  │            │          │ ↳ Daily: session count, pages  │
│                  │            │          │ ↳ Weekly: traffic trends       │
├──────────────────┼────────────┼──────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
│ Dub.co           │ MCP ✓      │ Community│ Link clicks, referrers, geo    │
│                  │            │          │ ↳ Daily: click counts          │
│                  │            │          │ ↳ Weekly: top links            │
├──────────────────┼────────────┼──────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
│ Substack         │ API ⚡     │ —        │ Subscribers, posts, emails     │
│                  │            │          │ ↳ Needs custom wrapper         │
│                  │            │          │ ↳ Use /mcp-builder to create   │
├──────────────────┼────────────┼──────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
│ Instagram        │ ✗          │ —        │ Unavailable                    │
│                  │            │          │ ↳ Business accounts only       │
│                  │            │          │ ↳ Requires Meta approval       │
└──────────────────┴────────────┴──────────┴────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 3.4: Handle Custom Wrapper Creation

For tools that need custom wrappers (like Substack):

```markdown
### Substack

Substack has an API that supports reporting data.

We can create a custom MCP wrapper to pull:
- Subscriber count and growth
- Post view counts
- Email open rates

Would you like to set this up now?
```

Options:
- `Yes, guide me through it` — Trigger `mcp-builder` skill with Substack API context
- `Skip for now` — Mark as skipped, can add later

If user chooses to create wrapper:
1. Invoke `/mcp-builder` skill with Substack context
2. Guide through API token creation
3. Scaffold wrapper using mcp-builder
4. User registers wrapper in Claude settings
5. Continue setup with wrapper connected

### Step 3.5: Outcome Mapping

```markdown
## Based on your Analytics tools, here's what we can include:

**Daily (Analytics):**
☑ Page views today (from GA4)
☑ Link click counts (from Dub.co)
☐ New subscribers (requires Substack wrapper)

**Weekly (Analytics):**
☑ Traffic trends (from GA4)
☑ Top performing links (from Dub.co)
☐ Audience growth (requires Substack wrapper)
☐ Social engagement (requires Instagram setup)

Note: Some options are disabled because those tools aren't connected.
You can add them later with `/design-ops:configure analytics`

[Confirm selections]
```

---

### Step 3.6: Analytics Summary & Confirmation

Before moving to Skills selection, confirm completion:

```markdown
## Analytics Summary

You've configured across 5 categories:

**Web Analytics:**
✓ Google Analytics (MCP) — sessions, pageviews

**Social Analytics:**
✓ Instagram (API) — followers, engagement

**Content Analytics:**
⚠ Substack — skipped (can add later)

**Link Analytics:**
✓ Dub.co (MCP) — link clicks, referrers

**Database/Product:**
⚠ None configured

**Before we move on:**
- [Add more Analytics tools]
- [Continue to Skills Library →]
```

**Pattern for every tool/category addition:**
```markdown
✓ {Tool} added to {Category}

[Add more to this category] | [Continue to next category →]
```

If user selects "Add more", return to the appropriate category selection.
If user selects "Continue", proceed to Skills Library.

## Chapter 4: Auto-Activating Skills

**Goal**: Configure skills that activate automatically based on context

DESIGN-OPS includes skills that activate automatically — you don't invoke them directly. They kick in when the context is relevant.

### Step 4.1: Explain Auto-Activating Skills

```markdown
## Auto-Activating Skills

DESIGN-OPS includes skills that activate automatically based on context.
You don't invoke them — they kick in when relevant.

**How they work:**
- You mention "brand colors" → `brand-guidelines` skill activates
- You're debugging → `systematic-debugging` guides root cause analysis
- You claim something is "done" → `verification-before-completion` runs checks

### Available Auto-Activating Skills

| Skill | Triggers On | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `brand-guidelines` | "brand", "Aperol", "colors", "voice" | Enforces brand identity |
| `frontend-design` | UI work, components, layouts | Component patterns |
| `design-system-quality` | Design system reviews | Compliance checks |
| `verification-before-completion` | "done", "finished", completing work | Quality gates |
| `systematic-debugging` | Errors, bugs, investigation | 4-phase root cause analysis |

**These are enabled by default.** They work silently in the background.

📖 **Browse the source:**
https://github.com/opensesh/DESIGN-OPS/tree/main/skills

### What would you like to do?

- [Keep all enabled (recommended)] — Skills work automatically
- [Review and customize] — See detailed descriptions, toggle individual skills
- [Disable all] — No auto-triggering skills
```

### Step 4.2: Handle Skill Selection

**[Keep all enabled]** (recommended):
```yaml
# Store in config:
skills:
  auto_activating:
    enabled: true
    items:
      - brand_guidelines
      - frontend_design
      - design_system_quality
      - verification_before_completion
      - systematic_debugging
```

**[Review and customize]:**
Show detailed description for each skill with individual toggle.

**[Disable all]:**
```yaml
skills:
  auto_activating:
    enabled: false
```

---

## Chapter 5: Utility Commands

**Goal**: Select which utility commands to import (optional, all available by default)

Unlike auto-activating skills, utility commands are **explicit** — you run them when you need them.

### Step 5.1: Present Utility Commands

```markdown
## Utility Commands

DESIGN-OPS also includes **14 utility commands** — explicit, on-demand tools you invoke directly.

Unlike auto-activating skills, you run these when you need them:

```bash
/design-ops:design-audit        # Run a design system audit
/design-ops:meeting-brief       # Create a meeting agenda
/design-ops:competitor-scan     # Analyze a competitor's site
```

### Available Utility Commands (4 categories)

**Logistics (3)** — Meeting prep, kickoffs

📖 **Source code:**
https://github.com/opensesh/DESIGN-OPS/tree/main/commands/library

### What would you like to do?

- [Import all (recommended)] — All 14 commands available
- [Select specific commands] — Choose which categories to import
- [Skip for now] — Add commands later via `/design-ops:library`
```

### Step 5.2: Handle Command Selection

**[Import all]** (recommended):
```yaml
# Store in config:
utility_commands:
  enabled: true
  categories:
    - logistics
    - content

## Chapter 6: Connection Verification Gate

**Goal**: Ensure all installed tools are actually working before declaring setup complete.

After skills and commands are configured, verify tool connections.

### Step 6.1: Collect Tool Statuses

Iterate through all pillars and categorize tools:

| Category | Status | Meaning |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Ready** | ✓ Connected | MCP responding, credentials valid |
| **Needs Auth** | ⚠ Installed | MCP installed but requires OAuth/env setup |
| **API Config Needed** | ⚠ Configured | API token needed, not validated |
| **Skipped** | — Skipped | User chose to skip |

### Step 6.2: Present Verification Summary

**If ALL tools are ready (✓ Connected):**
Proceed directly to Final Synthesis — no gate needed.

**If ANY tool has "Needs Auth" or "API Config Needed" status:**

```markdown
## Almost There — {count} Tool(s) Need Attention

Your configuration is saved, but some tools need additional setup to work:

┌───────────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tool              │ Status      │ Action Required                     │
├───────────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Google Workspace  │ ⚠ Installed │ Complete OAuth (runs on first use)  │
│ Supabase          │ ⚠ Installed │ OAuth login required                │
│ Notion            │ ⚠ Configured│ Set NOTION_API_KEY env variable     │
└───────────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────┘

**What would you like to do?**
- [Complete setup now] — I'll guide you through each one
- [Continue anyway] — Use what's working, fix these later
- [Run a test] — Try the dashboard to see what works
```

### Step 6.3: Guided Completion Flow

If user chooses **[Complete setup now]**:

For each tool needing attention, provide specific guidance:

**Google Workspace (OAuth):**
```markdown
### Google Workspace — Complete OAuth

Google Workspace MCP is installed, but needs OAuth authorization.

**To complete:**
1. Run any Google command (e.g., "show my calendar")
2. A browser window will open for Google OAuth
3. Authorize the app
4. Done — you'll see ✓ Connected

[Try it now: Run a Google command] [Skip for now]
```

**Supabase (OAuth):**
```markdown
### Supabase — Complete OAuth

Supabase MCP is installed, but needs OAuth authorization.

**To complete:**
1. Run any Supabase query (e.g., "show my Supabase tables")
2. A browser window will open for Supabase OAuth
3. Authorize the app
4. Done — you'll see ✓ Connected

[Try it now: Run a Supabase command] [Skip for now]
```

**Notion (API Key):**
```markdown
### Notion — Set API Key

Notion MCP needs your API key to connect.

**To complete:**
1. Go to https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
2. Create an integration and copy the token
```

**If 1Password detected (from session):**
```markdown
3. Store in 1Password:
   ```bash
   op item create \
     --category="API Credential" \
     --title="Notion API" \
     --vault="DESIGN-OPS" \
     'credential=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
   ```
4. The secret will be loaded automatically when you run `load_design_ops_secrets`

[I've stored it — verify now] [Skip for now]
```

**If no secrets manager:**
```markdown
3. Add to your shell profile:
   ```bash
   export NOTION_API_KEY="your-token-here"
   ```
4. Restart your terminal

⚠️ **Security note:** Consider using 1Password CLI for safer secret storage.

[I've set it up — verify now] [Skip for now]
```

**Figma (OAuth):**
```markdown
### Figma — Complete OAuth

Figma MCP is installed, but needs OAuth authorization.

**To complete:**
1. Run any Figma command or paste a Figma URL
2. A browser window will open for Figma OAuth
3. Authorize the app
4. Done — you'll see ✓ Connected

[Try it now: Run a Figma command] [Skip for now]
```

### Step 6.4: Final Status Check

After guided completion (or if user skips):

```markdown
## Setup Summary

**Ready to Use:**
✓ GitHub — Tracking opensesh/BOS-3.0
✓ Figma — Connected via OAuth
✓ Dub.co — 15 links tracked

**Needs Attention (will prompt when used):**
⚠ Google Workspace — OAuth required (first use)
⚠ Notion — NOTION_API_KEY not set

**Skipped:**
— Slack (can add later)

[Save and finish] [Continue fixing]
```

### Step 6.5: Store Verification Status

Store connection status in config for dashboard awareness:

```yaml
pillars:
  operations:
    tools:
      - id: google_workspace
        status: installed  # Not "connected" yet
        auth_status: oauth_pending
        auth_guidance: "Run any Google command to complete OAuth"
      - id: notion
        status: configured
        auth_status: env_var_missing
        auth_guidance: "Set NOTION_API_KEY in your environment"
```

---

## Skills Config Format

Store all skill selections in config:

```yaml
skills:
  auto_activating:
    enabled: true
    items:
      - brand_guidelines
      - frontend_design
      - design_system_quality
      - verification_before_completion
      - systematic_debugging

utility_commands:
  enabled: true
  categories:
    - logistics
    - content
    - development
    - design
```

---

## Team Member Mapping (Optional)

After skills selection:

```markdown
## Team Configuration (Optional)

Want cleaner output with real names instead of handles?

I can map:
- Figma handles → friendly names
- GitHub usernames → friendly names
- Platform handles → real names

This makes reports more readable.
```

Options:
- `Set up team members`
- `Skip — use handles as-is`

**If setting up team:**

```markdown
Add team members one at a time.

**Your info first:**
- Display name: [input]
- Figma handle (if using Figma): [input or skip]
- GitHub username (if using GitHub): [input or skip]
```

Loop: "Add another team member?" → Yes/Done

---

## Connection Types Summary

| Type | Description | How to Detect | Setup Process |
|------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| **MCP** | Native MCP server | In `~/.claude/settings.json` | Guide MCP installation |
| **API** | Direct API (plugin calls) | Token in config or env | Guide token creation |
| **Custom Wrapper** | User-created MCP | User registers after creation | `/mcp-builder` skill |
| **Unavailable** | No API/MCP support | API evaluation fails | Inform user, suggest alternatives |

## Error Handling

**If ~/.claude directory doesn't exist:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude
```

**If write fails:**
```markdown
Couldn't write config file. Check permissions for ~/.claude/

Manual fix:
1. Run: mkdir -p ~/.claude
2. Run: chmod 755 ~/.claude
3. Re-run /design-ops:setup

Still stuck? See: references/troubleshooting.md
```

**If API validation fails:**
```markdown
API check failed for {service}.

This might be:
- Network issue (try again)
- Invalid credentials (re-enter)
- Service outage (check status page)

Continue setup without {service}? You can add it later with /design-ops:configure.
```

---

## Re-Running Setup

If user runs `/design-ops:setup` with existing config:

1. Show current config summary with pillar breakdown
2. Ask what to change:
   - "Update a pillar (Operations, Design, Analytics)"
   - "Add new tools"
   - "Modify team members"
   - "Start completely fresh"
3. Only modify selected sections
4. Run verification tests

---

## Non-Destructive Guarantees

1. **Never overwrite** existing files without asking
2. **Always backup** before changes: `*.yaml.bak`
3. **Show diff** of proposed config changes before writing
4. **Merge** new settings with existing (don't replace wholesale)
5. **Namespace** all commands with `do:` to avoid conflicts
