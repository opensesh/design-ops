## Tool Examples

### MCP Connection (Notion)

```yaml
- id: notion
  type: mcp
  mcp_name: "notion"
  status: connected

  # Discovery metadata
  mcp_source: official
  mcp_package: "@notionhq/notion-mcp-server"
  mcp_confidence: high
  discovery_cached: "2025-04-17"

  capabilities:
    data_types: [pages, databases, tasks, comments]
    reporting:
      daily: [recent_pages, task_counts]
      weekly: [page_activity, task_completion]
      monthly: [content_growth]
```

### Community MCP Connection (GitLab)

```yaml
- id: gitlab
  type: mcp
  mcp_name: "gitlab"
  status: available  # Not yet installed

  # Discovery metadata
  mcp_source: community
  mcp_package: "mcp-gitlab"
  mcp_confidence: medium
  discovery_cached: "2025-04-17"

  # Warning for community package
  warning: "Community package - not officially supported"
  warning_code: community_package

  capabilities:
    data_types: [projects, commits, merge_requests, pipelines]
    reporting:
      daily: [recent_commits, open_mrs]
      weekly: [contributions, ci_stats]
```

### Dual MCP + API Connection (Notion with API Supplement)

For tools where MCP provides basic access but API unlocks richer reporting:

```yaml
- id: notion
  type: mcp
  mcp_name: "notion"
  status: connected
  # API supplement for enhanced reporting
  api_supplement:
    enabled: true
    token_env: NOTION_API_KEY
    reason: "Enables batch queries and activity history for weekly reporting"
  capabilities:
    data_types: [pages, databases, tasks, comments, activity_log]
    # Separated by access method
    via_mcp:
      - search_pages
      - read_page
      - create_page
      - edit_page
    via_api:
      - database_query_full
      - activity_log
      - bulk_export
      - user_analytics
    reporting:
      daily: [recent_pages, task_counts]
      weekly: [page_activity, task_completion, team_activity]
      monthly: [content_growth, user_engagement]
```

**When to use `api_supplement`:**
- MCP handles day-to-day operations (search, read, create)
- API supplement enables richer dashboard data (batch queries, history, analytics)
- Both are optional — MCP-only is always valid
- User was offered the API upgrade during setup via progressive disclosure

### HTTP MCP Connection (Figma)

```yaml
- id: figma
  type: mcp
  mcp_name: "figma"
  status: connected

  # Discovery metadata - HTTP-based MCP

  mcp_confidence: high
  validated: true
  install_cmd: "claude mcp add --transport http figma https://mcp.figma.com/mcp"
  api_docs_url: "https://www.figma.com/developers/api"

  capabilities:
    data_types: [files, versions, comments, design_context]
    reporting:
      daily: [files_edited, active_users]
      weekly: [design_versions]
      monthly: [project_progress]

  tracked_projects:
    - id: "123456789"
      name: "Design System"
```

  mcp_url: "https://api.supabase.com/mcp"
  mcp_confidence: high
  validated: true
  install_cmd: "claude mcp add supabase https://api.supabase.com/mcp"

  capabilities:
    data_types: [tables, queries, auth, storage]
    reporting:
      daily: [row_counts, active_users]
      weekly: [database_growth]
```

### API Connection (No MCP Available)

```yaml
- id: google_analytics
  type: api
  status: connected

  # Discovery metadata - No MCP available
  mcp_source: none

## Migration from v1.0

If you have an existing v1.0 config, `/design-ops:setup` will offer to migrate it.

### v1.0 Structure (deprecated)

```yaml
version: 1.0
figma:
  enabled: true
  api_token: "..."
  tracked_projects: [...]

github:
  enabled: true
  tracked_repos: [...]

team:
  members: [...]

workflows:
  daily: [morning_brief]
  weekly: [weekly_recap]
```

### Migration Mapping

| v1.0 Field | v2.0 Location |
|------------|---------------|
| `figma.*` | `pillars.design.tools[id=figma]` |
| `github.*` | `pillars.design.tools[id=github]` |
| `slack.*` | `pillars.operations.tools[id=slack]` |
| `team.members` | `team.members` (restructured handles) |
| `workflows.*` | `pillars.*.outcomes` |

---

## Validation Rules

### Required Fields

For `/design-ops:test` to pass:
- `version` must be "2.0"
- At least one pillar must be enabled
- Enabled pillars must have at least one connected tool

### Token Validation

**Figma token:**
```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" "https://api.figma.com/v1/me"
```

**MCP validation:**
Check that MCP server responds to basic queries.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Config Not Loading

1. Check file exists: `ls ~/.claude/design-ops-config.yaml`
2. Check YAML syntax: `python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open(...))" `
3. Run `/design-ops:test` for diagnostics

### Version Mismatch

If you see "Config version mismatch":
1. Back up current config
2. Run `/design-ops:setup` to migrate
3. Or manually update to v2.0 structure

### Tool Connection Issues

1. Check `status` field in config
2. Verify MCP is in `~/.claude/settings.json`
3. Test API token manually
4. Run `/design-ops:test` for specific tool tests
