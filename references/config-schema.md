```yaml
pillars:
  {pillar_name}:
    enabled: true/false

    outcomes:
      daily: [...]
      weekly: [...]
      monthly: [...]
```

### Pillar: Operations

**Common tools:** Notion, Google Workspace, Linear, Asana, Slack

### Pillar: Design

Covers creative work, code repositories, and design files.

**Common tools:** GitHub, GitLab, Figma, Sketch

### Pillar: Analytics

**Common tools:** Google Analytics, Dub.co, Substack, Plausible

---

## Tool Definition

Each tool in a pillar's `tools` array has this structure:

```yaml
tools:
  - id: string              # Unique tool identifier (e.g., "notion", "github")
    type: string            # Connection type: mcp | api | custom_wrapper | unavailable
    status: string          # connected | needs_setup | skipped | unavailable

    # For MCP connections
    mcp_name: string        # MCP server name as registered

    # For API connections
    auth:
      token: string         # Direct token (not recommended)
      token_env: string     # Environment variable name (recommended)

    # Capability matrix (auto-populated during setup)
    capabilities:
      data_types: [string]  # What data the tool provides
      reporting:
        daily: [string]     # Available daily metrics
        weekly: [string]    # Available weekly metrics
        monthly: [string]   # Available monthly metrics

    # Tool-specific tracking (optional)
    tracked_repos: [...]    # For GitHub/GitLab
    tracked_projects: [...] # For Figma/Notion
    tracked_files: [...]    # For Figma
    tracked_channels: [...] # For Slack

    # If unavailable or skipped
    reason: string          # Why tool isn't available
```

### Connection Types

| Type | Description | When to Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `mcp` | Native MCP server | MCP available and connected |
| `api` | Direct API calls | No suitable MCP, good API available |
| `custom_wrapper` | User-created MCP wrapper | API needs wrapping for MCP interface |
| `unavailable` | Cannot connect | No MCP or API available |

### Status Values

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `connected` | Tool is connected and working |
| `needs_setup` | MCP/API available but not configured |
| `skipped` | User chose to skip this tool |
| `unavailable` | Tool cannot be connected |

## Migration from v1.0

If you have an existing v1.0 config, `/design-ops:setup` will offer to migrate it.

### v1.0 Structure (deprecated)

```yaml
version: 1.0
figma:
  enabled: true
  api_token: "..."
  tracked_projects: [...]

github:
  enabled: true
  tracked_repos: [...]

team:
  members: [...]

workflows:
  daily: [morning_brief]
  weekly: [weekly_recap]
```

### Migration Mapping

| v1.0 Field | v2.0 Location |
|------------|---------------|
| `figma.*` | `pillars.design.tools[id=figma]` |
| `github.*` | `pillars.design.tools[id=github]` |
| `slack.*` | `pillars.operations.tools[id=slack]` |
| `team.members` | `team.members` (restructured handles) |
| `workflows.*` | `pillars.*.outcomes` |

---

## Validation Rules

### Required Fields

For `/design-ops:test` to pass:
- `version` must be "2.0"
- At least one pillar must be enabled
- Enabled pillars must have at least one connected tool

### Token Validation

**Figma token:**
```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" "https://api.figma.com/v1/me"
```

**MCP validation:**
Check that MCP server responds to basic queries.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Config Not Loading

1. Check file exists: `ls ~/.claude/design-ops-config.yaml`
2. Check YAML syntax: `python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open(...))" `
3. Run `/design-ops:test` for diagnostics

### Version Mismatch

If you see "Config version mismatch":
1. Back up current config
2. Run `/design-ops:setup` to migrate
3. Or manually update to v2.0 structure

### Tool Connection Issues

1. Check `status` field in config
2. Verify MCP is in `~/.claude/settings.json`
3. Test API token manually
4. Run `/design-ops:test` for specific tool tests
